# Devin/.gitignore/.gitignore.dev-prod (Conceptual - LIKELY REDUNDANT)
# Purpose: Specifies files/folders to ignore for both development and production (Ambiguous/Unconventional).

# =========================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTE ON STANDARD PRACTICE:
# =========================================================================
# Git uses a primary `.gitignore` file (usually at the project root) to define
# all necessary ignore patterns for the project lifecycle. This includes:
#   - Development-specific files (.venv, .env, *.pyc, .pytest_cache, IDE files, etc.)
#   - Build/Distribution artifacts (dist/, build/, *.egg-info/) relevant after building for production.
#   - Log files generated in any environment (logs/, *.log).
#
# There is typically no need for a separate file combining "dev" and "prod"
# ignores, as these should all be comprehensively covered in the main root
# `.gitignore` file provided earlier.
#
# This file is included conceptually based on the provided tree structure,
# but it should likely be removed or left empty in a refactored project structure,
# with all rules consolidated into the main `.gitignore`.
# =========================================================================

# No specific ignore patterns provided as this file's separate existence is unconventional
# and its intended rules should already be covered in the main .gitignore.
