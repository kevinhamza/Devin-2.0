# Devin/.gitignore/.gitignore.test (Conceptual - LIKELY REDUNDANT)
# Purpose: Specifies files/folders to ignore specifically during testing.

# =========================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTE ON STANDARD PRACTICE:
# =========================================================================
# Git typically uses a single `.gitignore` file (usually at the root)
# to define ignore patterns across all activities, including testing.
#
# Common test-related artifacts that should be ignored include:
# - Test runner caches (e.g., `.pytest_cache/`)
# - Coverage reports (e.g., `.coverage`, `.coverage.*`, `htmlcov/`)
# - Virtual environments used for testing (e.g., `.tox/`, `.nox/`)
# - Temporary files generated during tests (if any, often covered by `tmp/` or `*.tmp`)
#
# These patterns belong in the main root `.gitignore` file because they are
# relevant whenever tests might be run, not just in a specific "test environment"
# that would necessitate a separate ignore file.
#
# This file is included conceptually based on the provided tree structure,
# but should likely be removed or left empty, with all necessary test-related
# ignore patterns placed in the main `.gitignore` file.
# =========================================================================

# No specific test-only ignore patterns are typically needed here if the main
# .gitignore includes standard patterns like .pytest_cache/, .coverage, htmlcov/, .tox/ etc.
