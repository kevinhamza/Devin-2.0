# --- Philosophical Context ---
# Qualia refers to the individual instances of subjective, conscious experience.
# Examples: the perceived redness of an object, the feeling of warmth, the taste of salt.
# The "Hard Problem of Consciousness" (Chalmers) asks why and how physical processes
# in the brain give rise to subjective experience (qualia) at all.
# There is no accepted scientific theory or computational model that explains qualia,
# let alone allows for its simulation or creation in artificial systems.
# --- End Philosophical Context ---
