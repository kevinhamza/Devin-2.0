// Devin/assets/scripts/script_dark_light.js
// Purpose Undefined - Assumed Redundant

// This file's specific role is unclear given the presence of script_dark.js
// which should ideally handle all theme toggling logic (light, dark, system)
// by manipulating CSS classes based on user preference or system settings.

// It is strongly recommended to consolidate all theme-related JavaScript logic
// into a single, well-structured theme controller script.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    console.log("script_dark_light.js loaded - Purpose unclear, likely redundant.");

    // No functional code added here as its role is ambiguous and likely
    // overlaps with the main theme controller script (conceptually script_dark.js).
    // If there were hyper-specific JS logic needed ONLY when switching between
    // dark AND light themes (which is unusual), it could theoretically go here,
    // but standard practice handles this via CSS transitions or the main controller.

}); // End DOMContentLoaded
