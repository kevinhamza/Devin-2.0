 * =========================================================================
 * IMPORTANT NOTE ON REDUNDANCY:
 * =========================================================================
 * The existence and purpose of this file ('style_dark_light.css') are unclear
 * within standard web theming practices.
 *
 * Theme logic (switching between light and dark modes) should be handled by:
 * 1. Defining base styles and CSS variables (light theme) in `style.css`.
 * 2. Defining dark theme overrides (either by overriding variables within
 * a `.dark-mode` class selector in `style.css`, or within a separate
 * `style_dark.css` file).
 * 3. Using JavaScript to toggle the `.dark-mode` class on the <html> or <body> tag.
 *
 * There is no standard scenario requiring a 'dark_light' combination CSS file.
 * This file is almost certainly redundant if the recommended approach is followed.
 * It is strongly recommended to remove this file and consolidate all theme
 * styling into `style.css` (using variables and a `.dark-mode` class)
 * or potentially `style.css` + `style_dark.css`.
