/* Light Theme Styles - LIKELY REDUNDANT */

/*
 * =========================================================================
 * IMPORTANT NOTE ON REDUNDANCY:
 * =========================================================================
 * This file is generally NOT needed if the main 'style.css' file defines
 * the default appearance of the application, which typically serves as the
 * light theme.
 *
 * The recommended approach is:
 * 1. Define all base styles (layout, typography, components) in 'style.css'.
 * 2. Define light theme colors, fonts, etc., using CSS Custom Properties
 * (variables) within the ':root' selector in 'style.css'.
 * 3. Define dark theme overrides for those variables within a '.dark-mode'
 * class selector, either at the end of 'style.css' or in a separate
 * 'style_dark.css' file (as generated previously).
 *
 * Following that pattern, this 'style_light.css' file would contain no rules,
 * as the light theme styles are already the default in 'style.css'.
 *
 * This file is included conceptually based on the provided tree structure,
 * but should likely be removed or left empty in a refactored project structure.
 * =========================================================================

/* No CSS rules are typically needed here if style.css defines the light theme as default. */

/* If style.css ONLY contained layout and NO theming, then this file *would*
   define the light theme variables, like this (but this contradicts our style.css):
   body { --bg-color: #ffffff; --text-color: #333333; ...etc }
